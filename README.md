# Cepheus Engine Guided Character Generator

## Introduction

This project is a guided character generator for the Cepheus Engine, a tabletop role-playing game system. It automates the step-by-step process of creating a character, making it easier for players to get started with their adventures. The character generator is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, guiding users through each phase of character creation.

## Features

- **Stat Rolling:** Users can roll for their character's stats and decide where to allocate them.
- **Homeworld Selection:** After rolling stats, users select a homeworld for their character and choose one skill based on the homeworld's trade code.
- **Starting Skills:** Users determine their starting skills based on their Education (EDU) dice modifier (DM) and fill in the available slots with skills from a predefined list.
- **Career Phase:** After completing the starting skills, users can proceed to the career phase (to be implemented in future updates).
- **Copy-Paste Friendly Summary:** A summary section provides an easy-to-copy overview of the character created so far.
